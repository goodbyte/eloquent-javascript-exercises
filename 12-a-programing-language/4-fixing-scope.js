Fixing scope

Currently, the only way to assign a binding a value is define. This
construct acts as a way both to define new bindings and to give existing
ones a new value.
This ambiguity causes a problem. When you try to give a nonlocal
binding a new value, you will end up defining a local one with the same
name instead. Some languages work like this by design, but I’ve always
found it an awkward way to handle scope.
Add a special form set, similar to define, which gives a binding a
new value, updating the binding in an outer scope if it doesn’t already
exist in the inner scope. If the binding is not defined at all, throw a
ReferenceError (another standard error type).
The technique of representing scopes as simple objects, which has
made things convenient so far, will get in your way a little at this
point. You might want to use the Object.getPrototypeOf function, which
returns the prototype of an object. Also remember that you can use
Object.hasOwn to find out if a given object has a property
