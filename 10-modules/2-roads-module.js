/*

Roads module

Write an ES module based on the example from Chapter 7 that contains
the array of roads and exports the graph data structure representing
them as roadGraph. It depends on a module ./graph.js that exports a
function buildGraph, used to build the graph. This function expects an
array of two-element arrays (the start and end points of the roads).

import { buildGraph } from './graph';

const roads = [
  "Alice's House-Bob's House",   "Alice's House-Cabin",
  "Alice's House-Post Office",   "Bob's House-Town Hall",
  "Daria's House-Ernie's House", "Daria's House-Town Hall",
  "Ernie's House-Grete's House", "Grete's House-Farm",
  "Grete's House-Shop",          "Marketplace-Farm",
  "Marketplace-Post Office",     "Marketplace-Shop",
  "Marketplace-Town Hall",       "Shop-Town Hall"

export const roadGraph = buildGraph(roads.map(r => r.split('-')));
